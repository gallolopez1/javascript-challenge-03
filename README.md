# <u> Challenge instructions:</u>

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at some [examples of special characters on the OWASP Foundation website](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
